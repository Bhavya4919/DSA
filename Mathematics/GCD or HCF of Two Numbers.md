## [GCD or HCF of Two Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/gcd-of-two-numbers3459/1)

Given two positive integers a and b, find GCD of a and b.

A rectangular floor has dimensions 28 units by 21 units, and needs to be covered by identical square tiles. Whatâ€™s the maximum length of the square tile that can evenly cover the entire floor?

Find GCD(28, 21)

#### Euclidean algorithm 
```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
	if (a == 0)
	return b;
	if (b == 0)
	return a;

	if (a == b)
		return a;

	if (a > b)
		return gcd(a-b, b);
	return gcd(a, b-a);
}
```
Time Complexity: O(max(a,b))

Auxiliary Space: O(max(a,b))

#### Optimized Approch
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b==0) return a;
        return gcd( b, a%b );
    }
};
```

Time Complexity: O(log(min(a,b))|


Auxiliary Space: O(log(min(a,b))
